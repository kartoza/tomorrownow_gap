# OSIRIS II Global Access Platform

**Project Overview**

TomorrowNow.org is partnering with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) to develop and assess new weather technologies to support the seed breeding ecosystem in East Africa. The "Next-Gen" project focuses on adopting new or next-generation technologies to improve data access and quality.

**Goals**

The project aims to address two key challenges limiting the uptake of weather data in Africa:

1. **Data Access**: Provide curated datasets from top weather data providers, streamlined APIs, and a global access strategy to ensure long-term, low-cost access to weather data.

2. **Data Quality**: Localise forecast models using a network of ground observation stations, apply bias adjustment techniques, and produce analysis-ready datasets using best-practice quality control methods.

**Objectives**

* Improve data quality by measuring and benchmarking data quality and cost across top models for historical climate reanalysis, short-term weather forecasting, and S2S weather forecasting.

* Enhance data access through a global access strategy and partnerships with data providers.

**Impact**

By addressing data access and quality challenges, the project aims to accelerate the adoption of weather intelligence across the smallholder farming ecosystem in East Africa.

TomorrowNow provides access to the data through a RESTful API, available at https://tngap.sta.do.kartoza.com/api/v1/docs/
